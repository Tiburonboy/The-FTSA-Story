This is a story about a project that I was involved with, that seemed to run on forever.  I was the systems engineer for a telemetry system design which needed a safe and arm device for the flight termination system.  As the systems engineer I got stuck with doing a lot of schedules and budgets for the project as well as writing procurement specifications.  Contract monitoring was a major part of my duties.  One of the contracts I had to monitor was for the flight termination safe and arm device.   It was an interesting project in the beginning because it involved electronics and explosives and the explosives was something I initially knew very little about.  

I’ve been thinking about writing this story for several years.  When the contract with Kaman Aerospace was allowed to end, I was going to write a lessons learned paper.  So for a while now, I’ve been collecting background information with the thought of one day writing the story of the development.  This story is being written using Google docs and then various elements of the story mature, those segments will be posed on github.  Github will be the final resting place for this saga.
