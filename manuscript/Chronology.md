# Chronology  
Last update: 25 April 2018

* In 1998 the initial draft of the FTSA specification was generated and patterned off the JSOW FTSA specification. 
* FY-99 a concept development was funded for $261K.
* FY-00 $1.2M was allocated to fund the development in FY-00 and FY-01.  The development was planned to take two years with a CDR scheduled for March 2001.
* A CRADA was approved in October 99 with Raymond Engineering.  The original CRADA agreed that NAWC would provide the electrical design and qualification testing and that Raymond Engineering would provide the mechanical packaging design and fabricate engineering models and qualification units.
* In the Fall 2003 JAMI was contacted by the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser Project asking if the FTSA could be used in their new flight safety system.  This decision brought Eglin System Safety into the FTSA saga. 
* Feb. 5, 2004: A Production Readiness Review was held in February 2004 at Raymond Engineering.  Range Safety was satisfied with our RCC-319 Compliance Document and the design and documentation had been transferred to Raymond. 
* In March 2004 JAMI met with Ken Chirkis to discuss the System Safety analysis that had been requested by the Air Force.  The system safety office at Eglin asked that a checksum be implemented.
* In Nov 2004, explosive interface testing was conducted at Reynolds Systems to test the interface between the LEEFI and the FCDC. 
* A System Safety Working Group meeting was held at China Lake on 7 Dec 2004 to discuss the required actions required to approve the FTSA for qualification testing.
* On 13 Jan 2005 during a meeting with Navy System Safety that included folks from the Fuze Branch, System Safety, Range Safety and JAMI, approval was granted to press on with the qualification testing of the units. 
* Qualification testing started the week of 20 Aug 2005.  Non operational tests passed but there were failures during the operating humidity and operating thermal cycling testing.  Qualification testing was stopped while a failure analysis was performed.
* May 2006, continuation of environmental testing, failures encountered during buffet and non-buffet vibration.
* Meetings with System Safety at Eglin AFB: Nov 1, 2005 meeting; Dec 2005 meeting between Dale Spencer and AF; JAMI FTSA Meeting of April 13, 2006; Nov 8, 2006 meeting.
* Feb 27, 2006, Preston Parker and Ray Sanders called to say the design will not be approved for the following reasons: Use of EEPROM not allowed, configuration on power up not allowed, design is wholly reliant on FPGA and ARM on rail not allowed in airborne application.
* EMI testing: June 2006. EMI testing performed at TÜV America in San Diego; failed RE102, radiated emissions in the band 2 to 30 MHz and 30 to 200 MHz; failed RS103, showed susceptibility in the band 30 to 200 MHz on the HV monitor circuit.
* Brief to OSD on Jan 17, 2007 at Eglin AFB
* Approval for re-design, February 2007
* December 2006 through July 2007: developing SOW, test plans and procurement package
* November 2007 started proposal evaluation
* Sept 29, 2008 sole source contract signed with Kaman for re-design effort
* Integrated Baseline Review: 2 Dec 08
* Safety Design Concept Review: 9 Dec 08
* Funding shortfall, Contract modified August 2009, now fixed price, did incur a schedule slip
* PDR: October 2009
* Developmental Tests Part 1: June 2010, failed during thermal cycling test, cold solder joint, new unit delivered with changes in potting and some parts now epoxied to PCB
* Developmental Tests Part 2: Aug - Sept 2010, completed thermal cycling, humidity, captive carry vibration, intermittent failure to arm, other tests: EMI and centrifuge.  CE102 failure near 1.5 MHZ and RE102 failure near 400 MHz.  Investigating arming acceleration variation.
* Pyro-shock test: 22 Sept 2010, no upsets observed, no additional issues.
* Explosive interface test unit delivered 13 Sept 2010, explosive tests scheduled for 13 Nov 2010
* CDR: 28 Sept 2010
Pre-Qual test discrepancies on Qual units (DC resistance between pin 1 and pin 3) 20 Nov 2012
Qualification Test Discrepancies during testing, (Arm Accel, open circuit) Continued until hard failure  4/15/2013
Qual Units Failed.  Investigation followed.  KAMAN & Government let contract terminate???
NAWCWD address what effort it would take to do this in house August, 2012
And here we are……

2009: PDR
