This is a story about a project that spans more than 20 years. I wasn't involved in the beginning and I retired before the effort was completed, but I was there for much of the middle parts. This is a history of the development of a Flight Termination Safe and Arm (FTSA) device.  Later I’ll explain what those acronyms mean.  The use of acronyms is very popular in this industry.  

I’ve been thinking about writing this story for several years and I was going to write a lessons learned paper or some sort of case study.  So for a while now, I’ve been collecting background information with the thought of one day writing the history of this project.  

When the United States military wants to test a new weapon or upgrades, it often performs the tests at a military test range. There are about 15 large test ranges where test and evaluation takes place in controlled arena.  The ranges are equipped with radars, telemetry receiving equipment and other instrumentation necessary for these tests.  A test article, be it an airplane, missile, bomb or drone is usually instrumented so that the guidance or control functions on the test item can be monitored and the data analyzed.  If the test article is a one time usage device like a missile or bomb, the data is transmitted to ground stations during the flight.  Sometime it is necessary to have a method of terminating the flight of a missile if things go wrong.  A flight termination system is the name given to a collection of equipment that is used to remotely end the flight of a missile or test article that is not operating correctly and posses a threat to life or property.  

This story is about the design and development of one of the components of the flight termination system called the Flight Termination Safe and Arm (FTSA) device.  The story will also touch on areas such as some of my experiences working as a civil servant for the US Navy for 35 years and the design of a new telemetry system for an air to ground missile called the High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM).    

The FTSA is an interesting component because it is an electronic device that initiates the explosive chain leading to the destruct charge in a flight termination system.  As an electrical engineer the development of device to initiate an explosive component was a new area that was very interesting and outside the realm of anything that I had worked on before.
